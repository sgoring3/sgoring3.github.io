	Abstract = {It is well established that reading comprehension ability varies among individuals. However, there is disagreement regarding whether those differences can be attributed to differences in domain-general abilities (e.g., working memory capacity, WMC; Just & Carpenter,1992) or domain-specific abilities (e.g., language experience; MacDonald & Christiansen, 2002). Recently, Freed, Hamilton, and Long (2017) reported that individual differences in reading comprehension can be largely attributed to language experience and concluded that WMC is not an important factor. After re-analyzing structural equation models from Freed et al. and generating a psychometric network model of their data, we find that WMC is more important to individual differences in reading comprehension than was suggested by Freed et al. Overall, it was confirmed that both domain-general and domain-specific processes are associated with variation in reading comprehension.},
